This subdirectory is a demonstration of the MoorDyn-F driver. It is a useful tool if you are looking to work with the MoorDyn-F code directly without going through OpenFAST. This driver is set up to run the body.txt file from the exmple directory (the same as used in the jupyter notebook).

To run, you need to locate the MoorDyn driver from the OpenFAST release files, or compile it yourself. More information in this can be found in the [OpenFAST documentation](https://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/main/). Once locating the driver and moving it to this directory, run `moordyn_driver md_driver.dvr` in the terminal.

More information on the MoorDyn-F driver can be found in the MoorDyn docs [MoorDyn-F driver section](https://moordyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/inputs.html#moordyn-f-driver-input-file).
